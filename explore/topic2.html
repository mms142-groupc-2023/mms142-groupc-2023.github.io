            <h2>Energy Sector Conditions and the Need for Disruptive Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Since the energy industry is responsible for over two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, it plays a significant role in climate change and it is directly impacted by climate change, many of which are manifested through water (Walton, 2020). Therefore, as the global push for power modernization grows, natural gas, wind, and solar are fast replacing coal, which brought about the electric age over 140 years ago and was the primary fuel for electrification until recently (Kristoff, 2018). Thus, numerous energy technologies are emerging, adding new value to energy development and radically altering the worldwide market, driving the energy sector's rapid transformation (Pranadi, 2018).
                <br>Numerous energy technologies are emerging, adding new value to energy development and radically altering the worldwide market, driving the energy sector's rapid transformation (Hashisho, 2022). Energy for sustainable development, or energy sustainability, is a problem for many industrialized and developing nations (Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2022). Iddrisu and Bhattacharyya (2015) suggest that a roadmap for the switch to renewable energy sources is required, and it should be specific to each nation depending on its resources and current conditions.
                <br>The duration required for the primary energy supply to replace itself in relation to the pace of energy use is what characterizes renewable energy, hence why traditional resources with long formation times, like coal and oil, are not seen as renewable (John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, 2021). And as global warming is mostly caused by emissions from fossil fuels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 89% of the world's CO2 emissions in 2018 came from industry and fossil fuels (ClientEarth Communications, 2022) and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut by nearly half by 2030 (United Nations, n.d.).
