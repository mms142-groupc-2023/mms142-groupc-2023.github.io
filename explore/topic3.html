            <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels, garnering significant attention globally. This section aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the advantages and disadvantages associated with transitioning to renewable energy sources.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Advantages</p> 
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Compared to the usual use of fossil fuels around the world, the utilization of renewable and natural resources promotes protection of the environment.This is backed up by the fact that renewable energy produces little to none greenhouse gasses and other air pollution. (United Nations Development Programme, 2000). Renewable energy sources are abundantly available all around. The sun, wind, water, waste, heat— all sources of renewable energy that are replenished by nature. Maradin (2021) further added that renewable energy sources could be utilized to support already existing conventional energy plants resulting in reduced fossil fuel consumption. With the utilization of renewable energy, dependence on energy imports reduces, especially the importing of fossil fuels.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Another advantage mentioned in the article is the stimulation of development of innovation and economy. The decision to utilize renewable energy could stimulate the innovation for new technological processes for renewable energy, improving business and economic growth. In addition to this, innovation in the utilization for renewable energy would call for a demand in the workforce, resulting in an increased employment rate. The presence of renewable energy in undeveloped rural areas could boost economic development. Renewable energy sources could provide much-needed electricity in underdeveloped rural areas. In situations as such, renewable energy sources are a suitable investment due to the lack of development projects. Bringing renewable energy sources to rural areas aids in rural development. Bringing electricity to rural areas results in the reduction of energy scarcity, especially in undeveloped rural areas.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Disadvantages</p> 
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Renewable energy sources, despite the many advantages, also have their fair share of disadvantages. Renewable energy sources highly depend on its geographical location and weather conditions. Unpredictability of the renewable sources can lead to inconsistencies with availability of renewable energy sources based on the process of energy production. The inconsistencies caused by unpredictability of the renewable sources.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Acceptance of renewable electricity in the power system also poses concern when the aforementioned renewable energy sources are not available. A reserved amount of power should be available in case of deficiencies caused by unavailable renewable energy sources.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">It is also evident that when compared to the traditional fossil fuel energy sources, the renewable energy sources have a lower ability to produce electricity. This calls for more research and investments in the development of more renewable energy tech or simply a call to build more plants utilizing renewable energy. This calls for more surface area as well as higher energy efficiency. However, renewable energy sources achieve lower energy efficiency, with more than half of the renewable energy resources having below 40% energy efficiency. Despite this, higher costs of electricity production in a plant on renewable energy is very much evident.</p>
