            <h2>Renewable Energy as a Disruptive Technology</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Often known as clean energy, renewable energy originates from naturally occurring processes or sources that are continuously renewed (Shinn, 2022). Examples of renewable energy are sunlight, wind, marine, geothermal heat, and various forms of biomass (PennState Extention, 2023). Their diversity, abundance, and global use set them apart from fossil fuels, but perhaps most importantly, they do not emit any greenhouse gases or other pollutants that contribute to climate change (Acciona, n.d.). The development of renewable energy systems will enable the resolution of many of the current most pressing issues, such as enhancing the economy and reliability of the energy supply, addressing issues with local water and energy supplies, raising the living standard and employment of the local populace, ensuring sustainable development of remote areas in the desert and mountains, and putting national obligations regarding environmental protection into practice (Zakhidov, 2008).</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The availability of renewable energy is not scarce and is the cheapest power option in many parts of the world, but its potential is yet to be fully harnessed with the right and advanced technology (United Nations, n.d.). The fact that renewable energy is getting more and more affordable is one of its main benefits; in many areas, the costs of solar and wind power have dropped significantly, making them comparable to more conventional fossil fuel sources (Renganathan, 2023). However, the move toward renewable energy sources is considered one of the biggest disruptive developments in the energy sector (The Energy Training Centre, 2023).</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Traditional fossil fuel-fueled power plants are massive, centralized facilities that need a lot of resources and infrastructure to create and operate (Salonga, 2020). Conversely, wind and solar offer decentralization wherein a large number of smaller producing units cooperate to produce electricity (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2014). While the energy industry has been dominant on non-renewable energy as its main source and has been a dependent main source of energy for the masses, Renganathan (2023) adds that renewable energy is altering the production and distribution of energy and is disrupting the supply side of the energy business, creating more new opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship in the industry of energy. Furthermore, more integration and management of renewable energy sources into the electrical grid is made possible by the development of renewable energy technologies, such as smart grids and advanced batteries. This results in a more robust and dependable energy system that is better able to adapt to changes in supply and demand.
