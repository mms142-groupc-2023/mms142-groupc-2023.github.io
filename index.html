    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Creating a website about renewable energy as a disruptive technology would be a valuable resource to inform and educate individuals about the latest advancements in this field. The website could have a lot of detailed information about the different technologies, their advantages, and how they are competing with fossil fuels. It could also talk about how these technologies are good for the environment by stressing their ability to lower greenhouse gas emissions and make the air better. The website could also talk about the problems and restrictions that disruptive technology has in terms of being able to grow, being affordable, and working with current systems. It could also show how research and development is being done to get around these issues.</p>

    <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
    <p>According to the United Nations website:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-renewable-energy">
        Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.
        Fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are non-renewable resources that take hundreds of millions of years to form. Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.
        Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Transitioning from fossil fuels, which currently account for the lionâ€™s share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to addressing the climate crisis.
        Renewables are now cheaper in most countries, and generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels.</blockquote>

    <h2>Types of Renewable Energy</h2>
    <p>Some types of renewable energy include solar power, wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass energy. These sources harness natural resources that are constantly replenished, making them a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Each type of renewable energy has its own unique advantages and challenges, but collectively they offer a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.</p>
