        <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
        <p>Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. <br>
            Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. <br>
            Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.</p>

        <h1>Types of Renewable Energy</h1>
        <p>Renewable energy has different types, each offering a sustainable alternative to conventional sources. Solar, wind, hydropower, marine, geothermal, and biomass are among the prominent forms of renewable energy.
            Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to harmful greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy sources are abundant and produce significantly lower emissions. This transition 
            to renewables is crucial for combating the climate crisis, as they not only mitigate environmental impact but also prove economically competitive, fostering job growth and sustainability on a global scale.</p>

        <h3>Global Effects</h3>
        <p>Renewable energy is not merely a solution; it can also be considered a disruptive technoogy. 
            Advancements in solar panel technology and wind turbine design, emblematic of disruptive technologies, 
            have significantly reduced costs and increased the accessibility of clean energy. These innovations, 
            coupled with developments in energy storage, address the intermittent nature of renewable sources, 
            transforming them into reliable and consistent power providers. As disruptive technologies in the renewable 
            energy sector continue to evolve, they are propelling the transition towards a more sustainable and environmentally 
            friendly energy system, making it an increasingly viable alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based sources.</p>
